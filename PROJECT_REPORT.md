## Introduction

### What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input data. In the context of computer vision, deep learning models can automatically learn to recognize patterns, objects, and features in images without manual feature engineering.

### What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?

A Convolutional Neural Network is a specialized type of neural network designed for processing grid-like data, particularly images. CNNs use convolution operations to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features.

**Key Advantages of CNNs:**
1. **Parameter Sharing**: Same filter applied across entire image
2. **Translation Invariance**: Can recognize objects regardless of position
3. **Hierarchical Feature Learning**: Simple features → Complex features
4. **Spatial Relationships**: Preserves spatial structure of images

### Project Objectives

1. **Educational**: Provide clear explanations of CNN concepts
2. **Practical**: Implement a working image classification system
3. **Comprehensive**: Cover the complete pipeline from data to evaluation
4. **Reproducible**: Enable students to run and modify the code

## Mathematical Foundations

### 1. Convolution Operation

The convolution is the fundamental building block of CNNs.

**Mathematical Definition:**

For a 2D convolution:

```
(I * K)[i,j] = Σ(m)Σ(n) I[i+m, j+n] · K[m,n]
```

Where:
- `I` is the input image/feature map
- `K` is the kernel/filter
- `*` denotes the convolution operation
- `[i,j]` is the output position
- `[m,n]` are kernel indices

**Intuition:**
- The kernel "slides" across the image
- At each position, perform element-wise multiplication and sum
- Result is a single value in the output feature map
- Different kernels detect different features (edges, textures, etc.)

**Example:**

For a 3×3 kernel:
```
Input:        Kernel:       Output:
[1 2 3]       [1 0 -1]      
[4 5 6]   *   [1 0 -1]   =  Result
[7 8 9]       [1 0 -1]      
```

Output = (1×1 + 2×0 + 3×-1) + (4×1 + 5×0 + 6×-1) + (7×1 + 8×0 + 9×-1)
       = (1 - 3) + (4 - 6) + (7 - 9) = -6

This kernel detects vertical edges!

### 2. Activation Functions

**ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):**

```
ReLU(x) = max(0, x) = { x   if x > 0
                      { 0   if x ≤ 0
```

**Why ReLU?**
1. **Non-linearity**: Enables learning complex patterns
2. **Sparsity**: Many activations are exactly zero
3. **No vanishing gradient**: Gradient is 1 for positive values
4. **Computational efficiency**: Simple max operation

**Derivative:**
```
d/dx ReLU(x) = { 1   if x > 0
               { 0   if x ≤ 0
```

### 3. Pooling Operations

**Max Pooling:**

```
MaxPool(X)[i,j] = max{X[m,n] for (m,n) in Region(i,j)}
```

**Purpose:**
1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces spatial size (e.g., 32×32 → 16×16)
2. **Translation Invariance**: Small shifts don't change output
3. **Feature Abstraction**: Keeps strongest activations
4. **Computation Reduction**: Fewer parameters in subsequent layers

**Example:**

2×2 Max Pooling with stride 2:
```
Input:           Output:
[1 3 2 4]        [3 4]
[5 6 7 8]    →   [6 8]
[9 2 1 3]
[4 5 6 7]
```

### 4. Batch Normalization

**Formula:**

```
BN(x) = γ · (x - μ_B) / √(σ²_B + ε) + β
```

Where:
- `μ_B = (1/m)Σx_i` (batch mean)
- `σ²_B = (1/m)Σ(x_i - μ_B)²` (batch variance)
- `γ` (scale) and `β` (shift) are learnable parameters
- `ε` is a small constant for numerical stability (~10⁻⁵)

**Benefits:**
1. **Faster Training**: Allows higher learning rates
2. **Regularization**: Reduces need for dropout
3. **Stability**: Reduces internal covariate shift
4. **Better Gradients**: Prevents vanishing/exploding gradients

### 5. Loss Function: Cross-Entropy

**Mathematical Formula:**

For multi-class classification:

```
L = -(1/N) Σ(i=1 to N) Σ(c=1 to C) y[i,c] · log(ŷ[i,c])
```

Where:
- `N` = number of samples
- `C` = number of classes
- `y[i,c]` = 1 if sample i belongs to class c, 0 otherwise
- `ŷ[i,c]` = predicted probability for class c

**With Softmax:**

```
ŷ[i,c] = softmax(z_i)_c = exp(z[i,c]) / Σ(j=1 to C) exp(z[i,j])
```

**For a single sample:**

```
L = -log(exp(z_c) / Σ(j=1 to C) exp(z_j)) = -z_c + log(Σ(j=1 to C) exp(z_j))
```

Where `c` is the correct class.

**Intuition:**
- Penalizes confident wrong predictions heavily
- Encourages high probability for correct class
- Gradient descent minimizes this loss

### 6. Backpropagation

**The Chain Rule:**

For a composition of functions y = f(g(h(x))):

```
dy/dx = (dy/dg) · (dg/dh) · (dh/dx)
```

**In Neural Networks:**

For layers L₁, L₂, ..., Lₙ and loss ℒ:

```
∂ℒ/∂W₁ = (∂ℒ/∂Lₙ) · (∂Lₙ/∂Lₙ₋₁) · ... · (∂L₂/∂L₁) · (∂L₁/∂W₁)
```

**Algorithm:**
1. **Forward Pass**: Compute outputs and store intermediate values
2. **Compute Loss**: Calculate error at output
3. **Backward Pass**: Propagate error gradients backward through layers
4. **Update Weights**: Use gradients to update parameters

**Gradient for a single layer:**

```
∂L/∂W = (∂L/∂y) · (∂y/∂W)
```

### 7. Optimization: Adam

**Algorithm:**

Initialize:
- `m₀ = 0` (first moment)
- `v₀ = 0` (second moment)
- `t = 0` (time step)

For each iteration:

```
t ← t + 1
g_t ← ∇_θ L_t(θ_{t-1})                    (gradient)
m_t ← β₁·m_{t-1} + (1-β₁)·g_t            (first moment)
v_t ← β₂·v_{t-1} + (1-β₂)·g_t²           (second moment)
m̂_t ← m_t / (1-β₁^t)                     (bias correction)
v̂_t ← v_t / (1-β₂^t)                     (bias correction)
θ_t ← θ_{t-1} - α · m̂_t / (√v̂_t + ε)
```

**Hyperparameters:**
- `α` = 0.001 (learning rate)
- `β₁` = 0.9 (exponential decay for first moment)
- `β₂` = 0.999 (exponential decay for second moment)
- `ε` = 10⁻⁸ (numerical stability)

**Why Adam?**
1. Adaptive learning rates per parameter
2. Momentum helps escape local minima
3. Works well across diverse problems
4. Requires minimal hyperparameter tuning

### 8. Regularization: Dropout

**Mathematical Formulation:**

During training:
```
y = (1/(1-p)) · (x ⊙ m),  where m ~ Bernoulli(1-p)
```

During inference:
```
y = x
```

Where:
- `p` = dropout probability
- `m` = binary mask (0 or 1 for each neuron)
- `⊙` = element-wise multiplication

**Why Dropout Works:**
1. **Prevents co-adaptation**: Neurons can't rely on specific other neurons
2. **Ensemble effect**: Training many "thinned" networks
3. **Robust features**: Forces learning of redundant representations
4. **Reduces overfitting**: Acts as regularization

## Dataset Description

### CIFAR-10 Dataset

**Overview:**
- **Name**: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research - 10 classes
- **Images**: 60,000 color images (32×32 pixels)
- **Classes**: 10 mutually exclusive categories
- **Split**: 50,000 training + 10,000 testing
- **Format**: RGB (3 channels)

**Classes:**
1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

**Statistics:**
- Each class: 6,000 images
- Training per class: 5,000 images
- Testing per class: 1,000 images
- Image size: 32 × 32 × 3 = 3,072 pixels
- Color channels: RGB (Red, Green, Blue)

**Challenges:**
1. **Low Resolution**: 32×32 is very small
2. **Intra-class Variation**: Same class can look different
3. **Inter-class Similarity**: Different classes can look similar (cat vs dog)
4. **Background Clutter**: Objects may blend with background
5. **Viewpoint Variation**: Objects from different angles

**Dataset Normalization:**

We normalize using pre-computed statistics:
- **Mean**: RGB = (0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465)
- **Std**: RGB = (0.2470, 0.2435, 0.2616)

```
x_normalized = (x - μ) / σ
```

This centers data around zero with unit variance, improving training stability.

## Training Process

### Training Algorithm

**Pseudocode:**
```
For each epoch:
    For each batch in training data:
        1. Forward Pass:
           - Compute predictions: ŷ = model(x)
        
        2. Compute Loss:
           - L = CrossEntropy(ŷ, y)
        
        3. Backward Pass:
           - Compute gradients: ∇L = ∂L/∂θ
        
        4. Update Weights:
           - θ ← θ - α * ∇L (via Adam optimizer)
    
    Validate on validation set
    Update learning rate if needed
    Save best model
```

### Hyperparameters

| Hyperparameter | Value | Reasoning |
|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Learning Rate | 0.001 | Standard for Adam optimizer |
| Batch Size | 64 | Balance between speed and stability |
| Epochs | 20 | Enough for convergence |
| Weight Decay | 1e-4 | L2 regularization |
| Dropout (Conv) | 0.3 | Moderate regularization |
| Dropout (FC) | 0.5 | Higher for dense layers |
| Optimizer | Adam | Adaptive learning rates |
| LR Scheduler | ReduceLROnPlateau | Dynamic adjustment |

### Learning Rate Schedule

We use **ReduceLROnPlateau**:
- **Strategy**: Reduce LR when validation loss plateaus
- **Factor**: 0.5 (halve the learning rate)
- **Patience**: 3 epochs
- **Min LR**: 1e-6

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
LR_new = { LR_old × 0.5    if no improvement for 3 epochs
         { LR_old          otherwise
```

**Benefits:**
- High LR early: Fast initial learning
- Lower LR later: Fine-tuning to find better minima
- Automatic: No manual intervention needed

### Data Augmentation

Applied during training:
1. **Random Horizontal Flip** (p=0.5)
   - Doubles effective dataset size
   - Teaches left-right invariance
   
2. **Random Crop** (32×32 with padding=4)
   - Teaches position invariance
   - Creates slight translations
   
3. **Random Rotation** (±15°)
   - Handles rotated objects
   - Increases robustness
   
4. **Color Jitter**
   - Brightness: ±20%
   - Contrast: ±20%
   - Saturation: ±20%
   - Handles lighting variations

**Mathematical Effect:**
Original dataset: 50,000 images
With augmentation: Effectively millions of variations!

### Gradient Clipping

To prevent exploding gradients:
```
if ||g|| > max_norm:
    g ← g · (max_norm / ||g||)
```

Where `||g|| = √(Σg_i²)` is the L2 norm.

We use `max_norm = 1.0`.

### Early Stopping

We implement early stopping to prevent overfitting:
- Monitor validation accuracy
- If no improvement for 5 epochs, stop training
- Save model with best validation accuracy

**Criterion:**
```
Stop if: max(val_acc_last_5_epochs) < best_val_acc - 5%
```

---

## Evaluation Metrics

### 1. Accuracy

**Formula:**
```
Accuracy = (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Number of Predictions)
         = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Overall correctness of the model
- Range: 0% to 100%
- Higher is better

**Limitations:**
- Can be misleading with class imbalance
- Doesn't show which classes are hard

### 2. Precision

**Formula:**
```
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
```

**Interpretation:**
- "Of all positive predictions, how many are actually positive?"
- Measures false positive rate
- Important when false positives are costly

**Example:**
If model predicts 100 images as "cat":
- 80 are actually cats (TP)
- 20 are not cats (FP)
- Precision = 80/100 = 80%

### 3. Recall (Sensitivity)

**Formula:**
```
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
```

**Interpretation:**
- "Of all actual positives, how many did we find?"
- Measures false negative rate
- Important when missing positives is costly

**Example:**
If there are 100 actual cats:
- Model finds 80 (TP)
- Misses 20 (FN)
- Recall = 80/100 = 80%

### 4. F1-Score

**Formula:**
```
F1 = 2 · (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
   = 2TP / (2TP + FP + FN)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Balances both metrics
- Better than accuracy for imbalanced datasets
- Range: 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%)

**Why Harmonic Mean?**
- Punishes extreme values
- If either precision or recall is low, F1 is low
- Requires both to be high for good F1

### 5. Confusion Matrix

**Structure:**

|  | Predicted: Class 0 | Predicted: Class 1 | ... | Predicted: Class 9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Actual: Class 0** | $n_{00}$ | $n_{01}$ | ... | $n_{09}$ |
| **Actual: Class 1** | $n_{10}$ | $n_{11}$ | ... | $n_{19}$ |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| **Actual: Class 9** | $n_{90}$ | $n_{91}$ | ... | $n_{99}$ |

**Interpretation:**
- Diagonal: Correct predictions
- Off-diagonal: Misclassifications
- Row sums: Total samples per actual class
- Column sums: Total predictions per predicted class

**Normalized Confusion Matrix:**
```
C_norm[i,j] = C[i,j] / Σ(k) C[i,k]
```

Shows percentage of each class classified as each category.

### 6. Macro vs Weighted Averages

**Macro Average:**
```
Macro-F1 = (1/C) · Σ(c=1 to C) F1_c
```

- Treats all classes equally
- Good for balanced datasets
- Highlights performance on minority classes

**Weighted Average:**
```
Weighted-F1 = Σ(c=1 to C)(F1_c × n_c) / Σ(c=1 to C) n_c
```

Where `n_c` is the number of samples in class c.

- Accounts for class imbalance
- Emphasizes larger classes
- Better for real-world scenarios

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Modularity**: Separate files for each component
2. **Configurability**: Command-line arguments for hyperparameters
3. **Reproducibility**: Fixed random seeds
4. **Checkpointing**: Save best models automatically
5. **Logging**: Track metrics throughout training

### Memory Optimization

**Techniques Used:**
1. **Batch Processing**: Process samples in batches, not all at once
2. **Mixed Precision**: Can use FP16 for faster training (optional)
3. **Gradient Checkpointing**: Trade computation for memory (optional)
4. **DataLoader Workers**: Parallel data loading
5. **Pin Memory**: Faster GPU transfer

**Memory Calculation:**

For batch size B:
- Input: `B × 3 × 32 × 32 × 4` bytes (FP32) = `12,288B` bytes
- Model parameters: ~1.3M × 4 bytes ≈ 5.2 MB
- Gradients: Same as parameters ≈ 5.2 MB
- Activations: Varies by layer, ~10-50 MB per batch

**Total GPU Memory**: ~100-500 MB per batch (depending on B)

For B = 64: ~300 MB
For model + overhead: ~2-3 GB total

### Reproducibility

To ensure reproducible results:

```python
# Set random seeds
torch.manual_seed(42)
torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(42)
np.random.seed(42)
random.seed(42)

# Make operations deterministic
torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False
```

**Note**: Deterministic operations may be slower than non-deterministic.

## Results and Analysis

### Expected Performance

**Typical Results on CIFAR-10:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Test Accuracy | 75-85% |
| Training Time (GPU) | 15-20 minutes |
| Best Epoch | 15-18 |
| Final Training Loss | 0.3-0.5 |
| Final Validation Loss | 0.5-0.7 |

**State-of-the-Art Comparison:**

| Model | Parameters | Accuracy | Year |
|-------|-----------|----------|------|
| Our CNN | ~1.3M | ~80% | 2024 |
| ResNet-18 | 11M | ~95% | 2015 |
| ResNet-50 | 25M | ~96% | 2015 |
| ViT (Vision Transformer) | 86M | ~99% | 2020 |

Our model trades accuracy for simplicity and educational value.

### Learning Curves

**Ideal Training Curves:**

1. **Loss Curves**:
   - Training loss: Decreases smoothly
   - Validation loss: Decreases then plateaus
   - Small gap between train and validation

2. **Accuracy Curves**:
   - Training accuracy: Increases to ~85-90%
   - Validation accuracy: Increases to ~80-85%
   - Reasonable gap indicates good generalization

**Signs of Overfitting:**
- Training accuracy >> Validation accuracy
- Validation loss increases while training loss decreases
- Large gap between training and validation curves

**Solutions:**
- Increase dropout
- Add more data augmentation
- Reduce model complexity
- Add L2 regularization
- Early stopping

### Common Confusion Pairs

Classes often confused (why):

1. **Cat ↔ Dog**: Similar features (fur, ears, eyes)
2. **Automobile ↔ Truck**: Both are vehicles
3. **Deer ↔ Horse**: Similar animal shapes
4. **Bird ↔ Airplane**: Both can be in sky
5. **Ship ↔ Airplane**: Similar backgrounds

**Analysis**:
These confusions make sense! Even humans might struggle with 32×32 pixel images.

### Feature Visualization

**What Each Layer Learns:**

- **Conv1 (Layer 1)**: 
  - Edges (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
  - Color blobs
  - Simple textures
  
- **Conv2 (Layer 2)**:
  - Corners and curves
  - Simple shapes (circles, rectangles)
  - Textures (fur, metal, water)
  
- **Conv3 (Layer 3)**:
  - Object parts (wheels, wings, legs)
  - Complex patterns
  - High-level features

**Progressive Abstraction:**
Raw Pixels → Edges → Textures → Shapes → Object Parts → Objects

This hierarchical learning is the power of deep learning!

### Ablation Studies

**Impact of Design Choices:**

| Modification | Accuracy Change |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Remove Batch Norm | -5 to -10% |
| Remove Dropout | -3 to -7% |
| Remove Data Aug | -8 to -12% |
| Halve Channels | -4 to -6% |
| Double Channels | +1 to +3% |
| Use SGD instead of Adam | -2 to -5% |

**Conclusions:**
- Data augmentation is crucial
- Batch normalization significantly helps
- Dropout prevents overfitting
- Adam optimizer works well

## Appendix: Mathematical Proofs

### A. Backpropagation Derivation

**Objective**: Compute `∂L/∂W` for a layer.

Given:
- Input: `x`
- Weights: `W`
- Bias: `b`
- Activation: `σ` (e.g., ReLU)
- Loss: `L`

**Forward Pass**:
```
z = Wx + b
a = σ(z)
```

**Backward Pass**:

1. Gradient w.r.t. loss at output:
```
δ = ∂L/∂a
```

2. Gradient w.r.t. pre-activation:
```
∂L/∂z = (∂L/∂a) · (∂a/∂z) = δ ⊙ σ'(z)
```

3. Gradient w.r.t. weights:
```
∂L/∂W = (∂L/∂z) · (∂z/∂W) = (∂L/∂z) · x^T
```

4. Gradient w.r.t. bias:
```
∂L/∂b = ∂L/∂z
```

5. Gradient to pass to previous layer:
```
∂L/∂x = W^T · (∂L/∂z)
```

### B. Softmax and Cross-Entropy Gradients

**Softmax**:
```
softmax(z)_i = exp(z_i) / Σ(j) exp(z_j)
```

**Cross-Entropy Loss**:
```
L = -Σ(i) y_i · log(ŷ_i)
```

For one-hot encoded y (where y_c = 1 for correct class c, 0 otherwise):
```
L = -log(ŷ_c)
```

**Combined Gradient** (softmax + cross-entropy):
```
∂L/∂z_i = ŷ_i - y_i
```

**Proof**: This elegant result simplifies backpropagation significantly!

For the correct class c:
```
∂L/∂z_c = ŷ_c - 1
```

For other classes i ≠ c:
```
∂L/∂z_i = ŷ_i
```
